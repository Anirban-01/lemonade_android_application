It\'s the perfect balance of sweet and tart, making it extremely refreshing on a hot day. It\'s also very easy to make at home, requiring only three basic ingredients and a few minutes of your time. You\'ll never reach for bottled lemonade at the store againâ€”nevermind the powdered and frozen stuff. This recipe makes one pitcher of lemonade or about six servings. It\'s easy to scale it up or down depending on the size of your party. Feel free to adjust the sugar to make a more or less sweet lemonade, and enjoy it as-is or mix it into iced tea, punch, or even mixed drinks. Serve homemade lemonade at your next barbecue, pool party, or picnic to thirsty guests of all ages. It\'s sure to be a crowd-pleaser.</string>
